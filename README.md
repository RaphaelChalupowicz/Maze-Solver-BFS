# Maze-Solver-BFS
Python based application that detects and solves mazes using a trained neural network model and the Breadth First Search (BFS) algorithm. The project integrates several libraries such as OpenCV, PyTorch, NumPy, PyQt5, and Tkinter to provide a comprehensive solution from image acquisition to pathfinding.
