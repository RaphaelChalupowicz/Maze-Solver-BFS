# Maze-Solver-BFS
Python based application that detects and solves mazes using a trained neural network model and the Breadth First Search (BFS) algorithm. The project integrates several libraries such as OpenCV, PyTorch, NumPy, PyQt5, and Tkinter to provide a comprehensive solution from image acquisition to pathfinding.

Tested using `Python 3.10.5` (newer versions may or may not work)

# Key Features:

YOLOv5 Integration: Utilizes a custom-trained model to detect mazes in input images.
Image Processing with OpenCV: Manipulates and enhances maze images for better user interaction.
Pathfinding with BFS: Implements the BFS algorithm to find the shortest path in the maze.
User Interface: Provides an intuitive UI for image capture/upload, start/end point marking, and displaying the solution path.
